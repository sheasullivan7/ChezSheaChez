      <h1>Welcome to Chez Shea Chez</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Shea, a 21-year-old University of Wisconsin senior from New Jersey. Welcome to my cooking page!</p>

      <h2>The Story Behind ChezSheaChez</h2>
      <p>My nickname growing up was Shea Shea, pronounce Sh-ay Sh-ay. After taking French for almost 12 years, I have come to love the language and the cuisine. That's how I came up with the name ChezShea (meaning "at Shea's"). That instagram username was taken, so that's how ChezSheaChez came to be!</p>

      <h2>My Cooking Journey</h2>
      <p>My love for cooking started with my mom, an amazing chef who cooked almost every meal growing up. Ironically, I came to college with zero cooking skills and relied heavily on takeout. It wasn't until sophomore year that I started learning to cook, beginning with simple (and sometimes questionable!) meals.</p>
      
      <p>When I moved into my new place with a bigger kitchen during junior year, I decided to start this food page. Through this process, I've connected with amazing people who share my passion for cooking.</p>

      <p>My goal is to keep growing, learning, and sharing my culinary journey with all of you!</p>
