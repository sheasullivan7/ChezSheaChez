        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Shea Sullivan and I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying communications with a digital media certificate. Cooking has been a creative outlet for me, and I have always loved discovering new recipes to make, and am passionate about posting my recipes to social media!
        </p>
        <p>
            Growing up, I have loved traveling, but have specifically taken an appreciation towards France and French culture. Not just the food, but the passion that each chef takes into their food is inspiring. I hope to one day go back to France and learn more about how to recreate some of their dishes!
